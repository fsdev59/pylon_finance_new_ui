            <div className="content">
              <p>
                <span className="dondi">Dondi</span> matrix marketing ‒ is a
                closed system, without deadlines for slots, with a limited
                number of places and an unlimited number of reopens.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                In the matrix, the referral link is fixed the person who invited
                you. You always follow your superior partner, to each of the
                slots he activated.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <span className="dondi">Dondi x3</span> program below you
                is three places in one line.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                In the <span className="dondi">Dondi x6</span> program below you
                are two lines – 2 places in the first line and 4 places in the
                second.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                When you register in <span className="dondi">Dondi</span>, you
                open both programs simultaneously.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h1>SLOTS</h1>
            <div className="content">
              <p>
                In each of these two programs,{" "}
                <span className="dondi">Dondi x3</span> and{" "}
                <span className="dondi">Dondi x6</span> have 12 slots.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                All similar and work in the same way. Each subsequent slot is 2
                times more expensive than the previous one. Both income and
                profits from them are twice as high!{" "}
              </p>
              <p>How many slots can be activated immediately? </p>
              <p>
                As much as you want! At least all twelve at once! They have no
                expiration date, so you can not be afraid that they will burn.
              </p>
              <p>All active slots move and bring you revenue in parallel</p>
            </div>

            <div className="content">
              <p>
                The first slot of each program costs 0.025 ETH. They are bought
                together; separately, the first slot cannot be taken.
                Accordingly, the start to the matrix is generally 0.05 ETH.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                You can purchase all further slots separately, in order from the
                smaller to the larger. It is impossible to buy a third slot
                without having a second open.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h1>Dondi X3</h1>
            <div className="content">
              <p>
                All partners in your slots of the{" "}
                <span className="dondi">Dondi x3</span> program are your
                personally referral partners.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                When you invite partners, they take places under you. The
                distribution of payments when filling out the matrix
                automatically occurs as follows: &gt; The first referral partner
                takes a place under you. 100% payout goes to your personal
                wallet &gt; The second referral partner takes second place below
                you.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Payment is also instantly credited to your personal wallet.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                The third partner takes third place below you. You again receive
                100% income, but in the form of a reopen. A reopen recycles the
                same slot for you again, and you continue to receive income from
                it.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Reopening the slot, you take next free place in your superior
                partners’ slot. Accordingly, 100% for the reopen is transferred
                to your superior.

                makes a reopen, buying you the same slot again, and the payment
